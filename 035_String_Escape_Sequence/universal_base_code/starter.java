	System.out.println(" Even though you know this program is meant to insult you by now, you're still here which makes you a masochist alongside being a sad sack jerkoff who would rather bust a nut to 2d drawings than socially interact with a member of the other gender");

	System.out.println("You are the epitome of cannon fodder, an NPC, a side character, an extra, an expendable unit, and most of all a fucking disgrace to the rest of us");

	System.out.println("Your parents are sickened, your friends abandoned you, you have no assets or charisma, but at least the guy who pummels you will find some D grade enjoyment out of you");
	System.out.println("I can step on you and you'd enjoy being a stool, I can beat you, and you would encourage my boxing career, I can spit on you, and you'll drink it, as this digestive enzyme is the only human interaction you get besides getting fucked that you will ever experience");
	System.out.println("And when you die, they will say nothing, as you were a mere blip in the \"grand scheme of things\" as we are all, but you are less than a blip, you are a cork in this vast reality of atoms, molecules, cells, tissues, and organs");
	System.out.println("You were placed on this Earth to be next to useless and steal oxygen, food and water away from worthier beings and with this knowledge you don't feel a tinge of shame");
	System.out.println("I have nothing left to say, I will never have you in my brain, because I would rather save that space for a brain tumor, goodbye.");
